# üöç Onboard Stops Generator

>[!Note]
> **EDUCATIONAL PROJECT DISCLAIMER**
>
>This project is developed purely for **educational and demonstrative purposes**. While it aims to provide useful public transport information for Milan, it relies on data sources, including scraping information from `giromilano.atm.it`.
>
>**The terms of service for ATM (Azienda Trasporti Milanesi) regarding data usage are not explicitly clear, and this project may potentially violate them.**
>
>Therefore:
>- **Use at Your Own Risk:** We do not guarantee the accuracy or continued availability of the data, nor do we assume responsibility for any consequences arising from its use.
>- **Unscheduled Discontinuation:** This project, or parts of it, may be taken down or become non-functional unexpectedly if ATM's policies change or if the data sources become inaccessible.

>We advise caution and understanding of these limitations.

A simple command-line utility that downloads, processes, and combines public transport stop data for Milan, Italy, from the official ATM (Azienda Trasporti Milanesi) public data sources. This tool is a vital part of the [Onboard Project](https://github.com/onboard-project)'s data pipeline.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Automated Data Fetching:** Automatically downloads `stops.txt` for surface transport and metro stop JSON from official ATM sources.
*   **Unified Data Output:** Processes and combines disparate data sources into a single, clean `onboard_stops.json` file.
*   **Data Validation & Cleaning:** Ensures data quality by standardizing names, filtering invalid entries, and transforming data into a consistent format.
*   **Validity Tracking:** Provides the expiry date for the dataset and remaining days, crucial for the [Onboard Project server](https://github.com/onboard-project/server)'s [Status endpoint](https://onboard-project-api.vercel.app/status).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Download:** Visit the **Releases** page of this repository and download the `onboard-stopgen` executable for your operating system (e.g., `onboard-stopgen.exe` for Windows).
2.  **Place Executable:** Move the downloaded file to a dedicated folder (e.g., `C:\Tools\Onboard`).
3.  **Add to PATH:** To run the command from any location, add this folder to your system's PATH environment variable.
> [!TIP]

> - Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
> - Under "System variables" (or "User variables"), find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit...".
> - Click "New" and paste the path to the folder containing `onboard-stopgen.exe`.
> - Click OK on all windows to save. You may need to restart your terminal.

### Usage

Once installed and added to your PATH, using the tool is simple:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the folder where you want the `onboard_stops.json` file to be created.
3.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    onboard-stopgen
    ```
    This will generate or update the `onboard_stops.json` file in your current directory.
